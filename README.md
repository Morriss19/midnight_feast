Welcome to our game, The Midnight Feast!

Here you are playing as Scamps the Raccoon and controlling him with WASD or arrow keys. Currently the game has infinite floors with randomly generating food, we plan to add enemies at some point that will snatch Scamps' food away, as well as floor variation with size and obstacles.

The game officially ends when Scamps loses all his food, though we plan to add an ending for escaping the castle.
